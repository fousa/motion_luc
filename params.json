Just add this line to you Gemfile:\r\n\r\n    gem 'motion_luc'\r\n\r\nExecute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle install\r\n\r\nAnd BOOM, you're on your way!\r\n\r\n## What's included?\r\n\r\n### Try\r\n\r\nYou can use the Ruby on Rails like try method to try a method and if it doesn't exist no exception will be raised but instead nil will be returned.\r\n\r\n    object_variable.try :testing\r\n\r\n### Localize\r\n\r\nLocalize as fast as possible with this function that you can easily use everywhere. No more description, just pass the key and let iOS do the rest.\r\n\r\n    localize \"key.in.strings.file\"\r\n\r\n### Defaults\r\n\r\nJust by defining the DEFAULT_KEYS, you get easier access to the NSUserDefaults. Add there to your globals.rb:\r\n    \r\n    DEFAULT_KEYS = %w(username password)\r\n\r\nAnd next you can call these methods below:\r\n\r\n    Defaults.instance.username\r\n    Defaults.instance.username = \"me\"\r\n    Defaults.instance.username?\r\n\r\n    Defaults.instance.password\r\n    Defaults.instance.password = \"je\"\r\n    Defaults.instance.password?\r\n\r\n### Fit\r\n\r\nYou can automatically resize a label until it fits the text. Just call fit on the label instance.\r\n\r\n    label_variable.fit\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Jelle Vandebeeck\r\n\r\nMIT License\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\r\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\r\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\r\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\r\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\r\nthe following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\r\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
